# SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard Skrifter (SKS) in TEI XML

The material here was translated into TEI from the original kn1 format
by Karsten Kynde with some contributions from Sigfrid Lundberg.

The directories came to our project in a bagit format. We try to keep
it that way for the time being.

There are some ruby tools in
https://github.com/Det-Kongelige-Bibliotek/solr-and-snippets/utilities
for validating and creating bagit manifests.
